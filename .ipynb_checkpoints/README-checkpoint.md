# Data-Science-Toronto-Workshops
Here are the codes, and data sets I used to teach beginner's about basic data science technqiues.

In my Final Year at the University of Toronto, I joined the Data Science Club (Data Science Toronto) as a workshop instructor where I taught U of T students the basics of data cleaning
data modelling, and data visualization using Jupyter Notebooks.
